    \section{Problem 1}
        Suppose 4.00 mol of an ideal gas undergoes a reversible isothermal expansion from volume $V_1$ to volume $V_2 = 2.00\,V_1$ at temperature $T = 400\,\unit{\kelvin}$. 
        Find (a) the work done by the gas and (b) the entropy change of the gas. 
        (c) If the expansion is reversible and adiabatic instead of isothermal, what is the entropy change of the gas?

        \subsection{Solution (a)}
            The work done by a system is defined as an integral.
            \begin{equation}
                W   =   \int_{i}^{f} p\,dV
            \end{equation}

            We do not know the value of the pressure, but the ideal gas law can be used here.
            \begin{equation}
                pV = nRT \to p = \frac{nRT}{V}
            \end{equation}

            This in turn can be put into the above equation.
            Bear in mind thet the number of moles and the temperture remain constant.
            \begin{align}
                W_{\rm in}  &=  -\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \frac{nRT}{V}\,dV
                    =   -nRT\,\int_{V_i}^{2V_i} \frac{1}{V}\,dV\\
                    &=  -nRT\,\left[ \ln(V) \right]_{V_i}^{2V_i}
                    =   -nRT\ln\left( \frac{2V_i}{V_i} \right)\\
                    &=  -nRT\ln\left( 2 \right)
                    =   -4*8.31*400*\ln(2)\\
                    &=  -13296*\ln(2)
                    =   \boxed{-9216.1\,\unit{\joule}}
            \end{align}

        \subsection{Solution (b)}
            The entropy change of a system is also defined by an equation.
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta S    =   \int_{i}^{f} \frac{1}{T}\,dQ
            \end{equation}

            This is an isothermal process, so the temperature remains constant. 
            Due to that, we can simplify our equation for the change in entropy.
            \begin{align}
                \Delta S    &=  \int_{i}^{f} \frac{1}{T}\,dQ
                    =   \frac{1}{T}\int_{i}^{f} \,dQ
                    =   \frac{Q}{T}
            \end{align}

            We know the work done on the gas.
            The change in internal energy is correlated with the change in temperature ($\Delta E_{\rm int} = nC_V \Delta T$).
            Since there is no change in temperature, there would be no change in internal energy ($\Delta E_{\rm int} = 0$).
            This can be used with the first law of thermodynamics to find the heat inserted.
            \begin{eqnarray}
                \Delta E_{\rm int}  =   Q_{\rm in} + W_{\rm in}\\
                0   =   Q_{\rm in}  -   9216.1\,\unit{\joule}\\
                Q_{\rm in}  =   9216.1\,\unit{\joule}
            \end{eqnarray}

            This can be used ot find the change in entropy.
            \begin{align}
                \Delta S    &=  \frac{Q}{T}
                    =   \frac{9216.1\,\unit{\joule}}{400\unit{\kelvin}}
                    =   \boxed{23.04\,\unit{\joule/\kelvin}}
            \end{align}

        \subsection{Solution (c)}
            If the process is adiabatic, there is no net heat inserted in at all.
            This means that $Q = 0$. 
            Since the temperature is also constant, the net formula would be solvable.
            \begin{align}
                \Delta S    &=  \frac{1}{T} \int_{i}^{f}\,dQ
                    =   \frac{Q_{\rm in}}{T}
                    =   \frac{0}{T}
                    =   \boxed{0\,\unit{\joule}}
            \end{align}

    \section{Problem 3}
        A 2.50 mol sample of an ideal gas expands reversibly and isothermally at 360 K until its volume is doubled. 
        What is the increase in entropy of the gas?

        \subsection{Solution}
            The process is isothermal, so $T$ is constant, $\Delta T = 0$, and $\Delta E_{\rm int} = 0$.
            We can use this to find the work done on the gas.
            Since we are looking to double the volume, the formula for the final volume would be $V_f = 2V_i$.
            We can also use the ideal gas law here.
            \begin{gather}
                pV  =   nRT \to p = \frac{nRT}{V}\\
                \begin{align}
                    W   &=  -\int_{V_i}^{V_f} p\,dV
                        =   -\int_{V_i}^{2V_i} \frac{nRT}{V}\,dV
                        =   -nRT\int_{V_i}^{2V_i} \frac{1}{V}\,dV\\
                        &=  -nRT\left[ \ln(V) \right]_{V_i}^{2V_i}
                        =   -nRT\ln\left( \frac{2V_i}{V_i} \right)
                        =   -nRT\ln(2)
                \end{align}
            \end{gather}

            The work inserted is directly related to heat inserted, itself directly related to enchange in entropy, so we can use that.
            Bear in mind this is an isothermal process.
            \begin{gather}
                \Delta E_{\rm int}  =   0
                    =   Q + W\\
                Q   =   -W
                    =   nRT\ln(2)\\
                \begin{align}
                    \Delta S    &=  \frac{Q}{T}
                        =   \frac{nRT\ln(2)}{T}
                        =   nR\ln(2)\\
                        &=  2.50 * 8.31 * \ln(2)
                        =   \boxed{14.4\,\unit{\joule}}
                \end{align}
            \end{gather}

    \section{Problem 5}
        Find (a) the energy absorbed as heat and (b) the change in entropy of a 2.00 kg block of copper whose temperature is increased reversibly from 25.0\unit{\celsius} to 100\unit{\celsius}. 
        The specific heat of copper is 386 \unit{\joule/\kilo\gram\cdot\kelvin}.

        \subsection{Solution (a)}
            First we can calculate the change in temperature.
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta T    =   100\unit{\celsius} - 25\unit{\celsius}
                    =   75\unit{\celsiusdegree}
                    =   75\unit{\kelvin}
            \end{equation}

            Heat absorbed is calculatable from there from the change in temperature.
            \begin{equation}
                Q   =   cm\Delta T
                    =   386\,\unit{\frac{\joule}{\kilo\gram\cdot\kelvin}} * 2\,\unit{\kilo\gram} * 75\unit{\kelvin}
                    =   \boxed{57900\,\unit{\joule}}
            \end{equation}

        \subsection{Solution (b)}
        The change in entropy is calculatable by an integral.
        \begin{align}
            \Delta S    &=  \int_{i}^{f}\frac{1}{T}\,dQ
        \end{align}

        We have our known equation of the heat, which we can adapt for use differentially.
        \begin{gather}
            Q   =   cm\Delta T\\
            dQ  =   cm\,dT
        \end{gather}

        This can be put into the integral above.
        \begin{align}
            \Delta S    &=  \int_{25\unit{\kelvin}}^{75\unit{\kelvin}}\frac{cm}{T}\,dT
                =   cm \int_{25\unit{\celsius}}^{75\unit{\celsius}}\frac{1}{T}\,dT
                =   cm\ln\left( \frac{100\unit{\celsius}}{25\unit{\celsius}} \right)\\
                &=  386\,\unit{\frac{\joule}{\kilo\gram\cdot\kelvin}} * 2\,\unit{\kilo\gram} * \ln\left( \frac{373\unit{\kelvin}}{298\unit{\kelvin}} \right)\\
                &=  \boxed{173.3\,\unit{\joule/\kelvin}}
        \end{align}

        (a) What is the equilibrium temperature of the two-block system? 
        (b) What is the change in the internal energy of the system between the initial state and the equilibrium state?

        Calculate the change in entropy of the cube-lake system as the ice cube comes to thermal equilibrium with the lake.

    \section{Problem 15}
        A mixture of 1773 g of water and 227 g of ice is in an initial equilibrium state at 0.000\unit{\celsius}. 
        The mixture is then, in a reversible process, brought to a second equilibrium state where the water-ice ratio, by mass, is 1.00 : 1.00 at 0.000\unit{\celsius}. 
        (a) Calculate the entropy change of the system during this process. 
        (The heat of fusion for water is 333 kJ/kg.) 
        (b) The system is then returned to the initial equilibrium state in an irreversible process (say, by using a Bunsen burner). 
        Calculate the entropy change of the system during this process. 
        (c) Are your answers consistent with the second law of thermodynamics?
