    % \begin{multicols}{2}
        \small
        \subsection{Question 1}
            Give the operators corresponding to the momentum and energy of a particle.

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                \begin{equation}
                    \hat{p} = -i \hbar \diffp{}{x};
                    \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \diffp[2]{}{t} + V(x,t)
                \end{equation}
        
        \subsection{Question 2}
            Give the general form of an eigenvalue equation.

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                For operator $\hat{A}$, eigenfunction $\psi$, and eignenvalue $A$.
                \begin{equation}
                    \hat{A}\psi = A\psi
                \end{equation}

        \subsection{Question 3}
            What significance do the eigenvalues have?

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                The eigenvalue is the formula for or value of the component being searched for within the bounds of the eigenfunction.

        \subsection{Question 4}
            What significance do the eigenfunctions have?
                
            \subsubsection{Answer}
                The eigenfunctions serve as the conditions governing the system.

        \subsection{Question 5}
            Write down the momentum eigenvalue equation.
            
            \subsubsection{Answer}
                Ths is a \textit{solved} momentum eigenvalue equation.
                \begin{equation}
                    -i \hbar \diffp{}{x} \psi = \hbar k \psi
                \end{equation}

        \subsection{Question 6}
            Is the function $\cos(kx)$ an eigenfunction of the momentum operator?

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                No. 
                The first derivative of $\cos(kx)$ is $-k\sin(kx)$, which does not contain $\cos(kx)$ to the point that the sets of terms in the two equations are practically disjoint.

        \subsection{Question 7}
            Is the function $\cos(kx)$ an eigenfunction of the operator corresponding to the kinetic energy?

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                Yes. 
                The energy operator involves a second derivative.
                Taking the second derivative of $\cos(kx)$, we get $-k^2 \cos(kx)$.
                This does contain $\cos(kx)$, so it is an eigenfunction.

        \subsection{Question 8}
            An electron is described by the wave function $\psi(x)=Ae^{i \alpha x}$, where $\alpha$ denotes the Greek letter alpha. 
            What is the momentum of the electron?
            
            \subsubsection{Answer}
                Use the equation with the momentum operator.
                \begin{equation}
                    \hat{p} \psi = p \psi
                \end{equation}

                Plug in the momentum operator $\hat{p} = -i\hbar\diffp{}{x}$ and $\psi = Ae^{i \alpha x}$.
                \begin{align}
                    \hat{p} \psi    &=  -i\hbar \diffp{}{x}Ae^{i \alpha x}
                        =   \hbar\alpha\,Ae^{i \alpha x}
                \end{align}

                This does contain $\psi$, so we can divide that out of the equation.
                \begin{gather}
                    p \psi = \hbar\alpha\,Ae^{i \alpha x}\\
                    \boxed{p = \hbar\alpha}
                \end{gather}

        \subsection{Question 9}
            How would you determine whether or not a particular wave function represented a state of the system having a definite value of the momentum?

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                Use the eigenfunction equation for the momentum ($\hat{p} \psi$).
                If the result is a multiplel of $\psi$, then the wave function did represent a state of the system with a definitive momentum value.

        \subsection{Question 10}
            Calculate the dot product of the following two vectors.
            \begin{equation}
                A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}; 
                B = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
            \end{equation}

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                \begin{align}
                    A \cdot B   &=  4 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 1 * 2\\
                        &=  4 + 6 + 4 + 2
                        =   \boxed{16}
                \end{align}

        \subsection{Question 11}
            For the two vectors, A and B, given in the preceding question, evaluate item by item $BA$ and from there $A \cdot BA$.

            \subsubsection{Answer}
                \begin{align}
                    &BA =   \begin{pmatrix} 4 * 1 \\ 3 * 1 \\ 2 * 2 \\ 1 * 2 \end{pmatrix}
                        =   \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}} 
                    &A \cdot BA =   \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
                        =   16 + 9 + 8 + 2
                        =   \boxed{35}
                \end{align}

        \subsection{Question 12}
            Suppose a function f(x) is defined in an interval between 0 and 10 and an equally spaced grid is created by the command,\\
                {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont x = linspace(0.0,10.0,10)}
            and suppose the values of the function at the two Gauss quadrature points, $\xi_{i1}$ and $\xi_{i2}$, within each interval are known.
            Write down a formula for determining the value of the following integral in terms of the values of the function at the Gauss points.
            \begin{equation}
                \int_{0}^{10} f(x)\,dx
            \end{equation}

        \subsection{Question 13}
            Suppose a differential equation is solved using spline collocation on a grid created by the command {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont x = linspace(0.0,10.0,10)}.
            How many rows and columns do the A, B, and C matrices have?

        \subsection{Question 15}

        \subsection{Question 16}
            Is the wavelength of a particle that has passed over a potential barrier greater than or less than the wavelength of the incident particle?

        \subsection{Question 17}
            Sketch the wave function of an electron which tunnels through a potential barrier located between 0 and L.

        \subsection{Question 18}
            Write down the Heisenberg uncertainty relations for the position and the momentum and for the time and the energy.

        \subsection{Question 19}
            Use the Heisenberg relation for the time and the energy to describe how the energy profile of an excited atomic state depends upon the lifetime of the state.

        \subsection{Question 20}
            How would the wave function $\psi(x)$ of a particle change as the width of the Fourier transform increases?

        \subsection{Question 21}
            Suppose that a particle localized between a and b is described by the wave function $\psi(x)$. Write down an equation for the average value of the kinetic energy of the particle.

    \section{Problem 1}
        Evaluate the product of the momentum operator and each of the two functions
        \begin{gather}
            \phi_1(x) = \cos\,kx\\
            \phi_2(x) = \sin\,kx
        \end{gather}
        Are these functions eigenfunctions of the momentum operator?

        \subsection{Solution (1)}
            The momentum operator is $\hat{p} = -i\hbar\diffp{}{x}$, which we can apply here.
            \begin{align}
                \hat{p}\,\phi_1(x)  &=  -i\hbar\diffp{}{x} (\cos\,kx)
                    =   i\hbar k \sin\,kx
            \end{align}

            This does not contain $\phi_1$, so it is not an eigenfunction of $\hat{p}$.

        \subsection{Solution (2)}
            The momentum operator is $\hat{p} = -i\hbar\diffp{}{x}$, which we can apply here.
            \begin{align}
                \hat{p}\,\phi_2(x)  &=  -i\hbar\diffp{}{x} (\sin\,kx)
                    =   -i\hbar k \cos\,kx
            \end{align}

            This does not contain $\phi_2$, so it is not an eigenfunction of $\hat{p}$.

    \section{Problem 2}
        Find a linear combination of the functions, $\phi_1(x)$ and $\phi_2(x)$, defined in the previous problem, which is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator.

        \subsection{Solution}
            We know that Euler's identity is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator. 
            \begin{equation}
                e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
            \end{equation}

            We can change $x$ into $kx$.
            \begin{equation}
                e^{ikx} = \cos(kx) + i\sin(kx)
            \end{equation}

            This is a linear combination of $\phi_1(x)$ and $\phi_2(x)$, just a complex one.
            We can check if it is an eigenfunction of the momentum operator.
            \begin{align}
                \hat{p}\,\psi(x)    &=  -i\hbar\diffp{}{x} (\cos(kx) + i\sin(kx))
                    =   -i\hbar\diffp{}{x} (e^{ikx})\\
                    &=  -i\hbar (ik\e{ikx})
                    =   \hbar k \e{ikx}
                    =   \hbar k \psi(x) \qed
            \end{align}
        \pagebreak

    \section{Problem 8}
        \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.33\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Image_5-8.png}
            \caption[3.5]{Potential Step}
            \label{fig:3.5}
        \end{wrapfigure}
        For the scattering problem illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:3.5}, a particle is incident upon a potential step with the energy of the incident particle being less than the step height.
        Using the notation for this problem given in the text, derive expressions the ratios $A/C$ and $B/C$ and show that $R = 1$.

        \subsection{Solution}

    \section{Problem 10}
        Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, estimate the momentum of an electron confined to a 1.0 nm well.
