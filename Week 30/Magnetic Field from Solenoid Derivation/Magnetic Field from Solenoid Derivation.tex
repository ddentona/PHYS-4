        \textbf{A Document Detailing the Derivation of Magnetic Field from a Solenoid}\\
        Author: Think the Duck
    \end{center}
    This is a document meant for the sole purpose of deriving the formula for the total magnetic field from the circular center of and on the axis perpendicular to a solenoid at a distance relative to one edge of the solenoid.
    We will be doing this in cartesian coordinates and by only using one axis.
    The derivation of the magnetic field from a ring of current can be found on a different document.

    This document has fulfilled its sole purpose.
